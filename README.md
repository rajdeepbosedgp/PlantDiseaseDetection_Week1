Plant Disease Detection System is a deep learning-based system that detects multiple plant diseases from leaf images. The project employs image classification methods with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that has been trained on a vast dataset of healthy and diseased images of leaves from various plant species. The aim is to help farmers and agriculture professionals through a quick, automated, and accurate means of early detection of diseases through image processing.
